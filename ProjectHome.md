Lingua is a jQuery plugin which simplifies web app localization through automated processing of text files containing language-specific key/value pairs. The text files are very simple to create, they are easy to update by translators, and they are easy to deploy and use. The plugin also supports a degree of automated translation by specifying #-prefixed keynames which match element IDs in your HTML.
